First challenge:

A perfect binary tree has post-order traversal like : 1,2,3,...,2^n-1 where n is the height of the tree
This solution is for finding the parent node of specific node
This solution is written in Python.

Second challenge:

Design an algorithm that:
Given a integer in base n, do the subtraction of (the digits in descending order) and (the digits in ascending order)
using the result as new integer and do the same step
Afterward find the length of a cycle of the result.
